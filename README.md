Introduction to the project
This is a project in the Odin project's curriculum where I will be exercising the basics of Hypermarkup Text Language (HTML). I will be exercising the following:
1. Understanding and drilling HTML for a basic website
2. Learning tags and their different functions (Links, images etc.)
3. Creating directories and files through our local terminal as well as linking them for their individual purposes throughout the pages of the website.
4. Developing useful Commit habits for better organization while building a website.
